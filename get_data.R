# You can only have one task with the same name, make sure you use taskscheduler_delete the task if you are planning to create a new task with the same name.
# Tasks are only run if your computer is on and your cable is plugged in
# Consider using the startdate argument of taskscheduler_create (scheduling something at 9/2/2018 means something different than 2/9/2018 depending on your locale)
